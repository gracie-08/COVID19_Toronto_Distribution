# Overview_of_Paper

This repository explores data from "COVID-19 Cases in Toronto" from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. I wanted to visualize the distribution of COVID-19 cases between age groups and genders, and taking a look at the sources of infection and how it relates to the two identified demographic pointers. 

After this exploratory analysis, I found that the data is vulnerable to cahnges and correction as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and that it is still unclear whether gender has an effect on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 cases.
